Pyelonephritis: its course and diagnosis in pregnant women; the course and management of pregnancy, labor. Principles of medical treatment.

Acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy is a serious systemic illness that can progress to maternal sepsis, preterm labor and premature delivery. The diagnosis is made when the presence of bacteriuria is accompanied by systemic symptoms or signs such as fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and flank pain. Symptoms of lower tract infection (i.e., frequency and dysuria) may or may not be present. Pyelonephritis occurs in 2 percent of pregnant women; up to 23 percent of these women have a recurrence during the same pregnancy.

Early, aggressive treatment is important in preventing complications from pyelonephritis. Hospitalization, although often indicated, is not always necessary. However, hospitalization is indicated for patients who are exhibiting signs of sepsis, who are vomiting and unable to stay hydrated, and who are having contractions. A randomized study of 90 obstetric inpatients with pyelonephritis compared treatment with oral cephalexin to treatment with intravenous cephalothin (Keflin) and found no difference between the two groups in the success of therapy, infant birth weight or preterm deliveries.

Further support for outpatient therapy is provided in a randomized clinical trial that compared standard inpatient, intravenous treatment to outpatient treatment with intramuscular ceftriaxone (Rocephin) plus oral cephalexin. Response to antibiotic therapy in each group was similar, with no evident differences in the number of recurrent infections or preterm deliveries.

Antibiotic therapy (and intravenous fluids, if hospitalization is required) may be initiated before obtaining the results of urine culture and sensitivity. Several antibiotic regimens may be used. A clinical trial comparing three parenteral regimens found no differences in length of hospitalization, recurrence of pyelonephritis or preterm delivery. Patients in this trial were randomized to receive treatment with intravenous cefazolin (Ancef), intravenous gentamycin plus ampicillin, or intramuscular ceftriaxone.

Parenteral treatment of pyelonephritis should be continued until the patient becomes afebrile. Most patients respond to hydration and prompt antibiotic treatment within 24 to 48 hours. The most common reason for initial treatment failure is resistance of the infecting organism to the antibiotic. If fever continues or other signs of systemic illness remain after appropriate antibiotic therapy, the possibility of a structural or anatomic abnormality should be investigated. Persistent infection may be caused by urolithiasis, which occurs in one of 1,500 pregnancies, or less commonly, congenital renal abnormalities or a perinephric abscess.

Diagnostic tests may include renal ultrasonography or an abbreviated intravenous pyelogram. The indication to perform an intravenous pyelogram is persistent infection after appropriate antibiotic therapy when there is the suggestion of a structural abnormality not evident on ultrasonography. Even the low-dose radiation involved in an intravenous pyelogram, however, may be dangerous to the fetus and should be avoided if possible.

Abnormal uterine action

Сlassification

• With normal polarity:

✓Hypotonic dysfunctions (uterine inertia)

✓Hypertonic dysfunctions (excessive contractions)

• With abnormal polarity (incoordinate uterine action):

✓spastic lower uterine segment,
✓ colicky uterus,✓asymmetrical uterine contraction, ✓constriction ring

✓generalized tonic contraction of the uterus ✓cervical dystocia

Etiology of Abnormal Uterine Action

Pathology of mother’s organism:

Prolonged pregnancy
Somatic disease and obstetrical complications
Emotional factor (anxiety, stress, fatigue)
Overdistension of the uterus (twins, big fetus, polyhidramnion)
Constitutional factor (obesity)
Pathological changes in the myometrium
Contracted pelvis
Weakness of the abdominal muscles in multiparous women
Defects of the abdominal wall
Placental and fetal pathology:

Malformations of the nervous system of the fetus
Aplasia of the fetal adrenal glands
Placenta previa and its low location
Accelerated or delayed of placenta maturation
• Malpresentation
Administration of sedatives, analgesics and oxytocics

Pathogenesis

CNS and ANS disorders that provide complex labor coordination mechanisms
reduction of specific α- and β-adrenergic receptors, which determine synchronization of uterine body contraction and relaxation of the lower segment
reduction in prostaglandin synthesis and ratio of E2 and F2α, changing rhythmic release of oxytocin
decrease of biochemical processes in the myometrium, supporting the energy supply of the uterus
change localization of “pacemaker” that from the angle of the tube can move to the center area of ​​the body to the lower uterine segment
Diagnosis of uterine inertia (hypotonic uterine dysfunction)

Primary dysfunctional labor develops from the onset of labor in the latent phase of the first period

Secondary dysfunctional labor develops into an active phase of the first period after variable period of effective contractions or in the period of expulsion

Patient feels less pain during uterine contraction
External examination
Palpation during uterine contraction reveals less hardening
Uterus becomes relaxed after the contraction
Fetal parts are well palpable and fetal heart rate remains normal
Internal examination
slow dilatation of the cervix
membranes usually remain intact
presenting part of the fetus is slowly moving down the birth canal
CTG
All characteristics of uterine contractions are less then normal
Complications of uterine inertia

Delayeddelivery
Maternalfatigue
Extended waterless period
Genital tract infection
Hypo-oratonicbleeding
Inflammatory disease in the postpartum period
Treatment of uterine inertia during the 1 stage of labor:

Amniotomy (artificial rupture of membranes)
Oxytocics : OXYTOCIN
Has strong uterotonic effect on smooth muscle cells of the myometrium
Oxytocin can be used only after the rupture of amniotic membranes
Safety and efficacy of intravenous oxytocin depend on individual sensitivity of the uterus to oxytocin, the correct dosage of the drug
Cesarean section
Complications of oxytocics:

Uterine hyperfunction
Incoordinate uterine action
Placentalabruption
Uterine rupture
Fetal hypoxia, fetal trauma, intrapartum fetal death
Cesarean section is indicated in combination of primary hypotonic dysfunction with risk factors:

big fetus,
malpresentaytions,
contracted pelvis,
fetal hypoxia,
scar on the uterus,
primiparous age 30 years and older,
bad obstetrics history,
preeclampsy,
somatic diseases
prolonged pregnancy,
premature birth
Treatment of uterine inertia during the 2 stage of labor

• Oxytocics
• In the absence of the effect of drug therapy: ✓CS
✓perineotomy+forceps or vacuum-extractor

The presence of irregular painful contractions with different intensity and duration

The lower segment contractions are stronger

Inadequate relaxation in between contractions - basal tone is raised above the critical level of 20 mm Hg

There are premature attempts to bear down

Palpation of the fetal parts is difficult

labor inefficiency, delay opening of the cervix, cervical edema, flat amniotic sac, high localization of the presenting part

Tired mother, arrest of labor Fetal distress appears early

GENERALIZED TONIC CONTRACTION ( Uterine tetany)

• New pacemakers appear all over the uterus

• In this condition, pronounced retraction occurs involving whole of the uterus up to the level of internal os

• There is no physiological differentiation of the active upper segment and the passive lower segment of the uterus.

• The whole uterus undergoes a sort of tonic muscular spasm holding the fetus inside (active retention of the fetus)

CONSTRICTION RING

Localized myometrial contraction formes a ring of circular muscle fibers of the uterus
It is usually situated at the junction of the upper and lower segment around a constricted part of the fetus
usually around the neck in cephalic presentation
Complications of incoordinate uterine action

Premature rupture of membranes
Delayed delivery
Placental abruption
Amniotic fluid embolism
Hypo-and atonic bleeding
High frequency of fetal distress, acute hypoxia
Aspiration of amniotic fluid with meconium
Birth injuries
High frequency of operative delivery
Septic complications
Treatment of incoordinate uterine action

There is no place of oxytocin augmentation
Cesarean section is done in majority of cases
Prevention of abnormal uterine action

• Select a group of high-risk

❖psychoprophylactic training

❖prenatal education

❖friendly attitude

❖pain relief medication, spinal and epidural anesthesia

❖partnership delivery

Excessive uterine activity (precipitate labor): clinical features, diagnosis, methods of correction, prevention. The labor management. Complications for the mother and fetus.
Hypertonic dysfunction (excessive contractions)

• Strong,long-lastingand frequent contractions

• rapidprogressionof cervical dilatation

fast fetal progression through the birth chanel
rapid or prompt delivery (precipitate labor – all stages of labor less than 2 hours))
Complications of hypertonic dysfunction

Extensive laceration of the cervix, vagina and perineum
Uterine rupture
Placental abruption
Amniotic fluid embolism
PPH due to uterine hypotonia
Postpartum infectious complications
Fetal hypoxia and injuries - intracranial hemorrhage because of rapid expulsion without time for moulding of the head
Treatment of hypertonic dysfunction

• The patient with previous history of precipitate labor should be hospitalized prior to labor

– Oxytocin augmentation should be avoided
– During labor the uterine contraction may be suppressed by
administering magnesium sulfate, antispasmodics, tocolytics

– Management of 2 stage of labor "on the side“ position
– Delivery of the head should be controlled
– Episiotomy should be done liberally
69. Obstructed labor: clinical features, diagnosis, methods of correction, prevention. The labor management. Complications for the mother and fetus.

Obstructed Labor: also known as labor dystocia, is a failure to progress due to mechanical problems—a mismatch between fetal size, or more accurately, the size of the presenting part of the fetus, and the mother’s pelvis, although some malpresentation, notably a brow presentation or a shoulder presentation.

CONTRACTED PELVIS

Anatomically contracted pelvis is characterized by shortening of

one diameters of the true pelvis into 1,5 - 2 cm and more. Clinically or functional contracted pelvis is usually defined as jviS with normal dimensions, but vaginally delivery is impossible due to “fetopelvic disproportion”.

The main causes of “cephalopelvic disproportion” are fetal macrosomia, postdate pregnancy, uterine inertia, fetal malpresentation, especially fetal head extension — sinciput vertex,brow,face anterior position, ninic signs of clinically contracted pelvis:

Head is arrested in the pelvic inlet (absence of fetal descending in complete cervical dilation and adequate uterine contractions).

Uterine contractions abnormality.

Positive Vasten’ sign (if disproportion between fetal head and symphisis pubis is prominent — Vasten’ sign is positive, if disproportion between fetal head and symphisis pubis is absent - Vasten’ sign is negative).

Signs of urinary bladder compression.

Edema of the cervix, and vaginal walls, productions of fistulas. When the presenting part is firmly wedged into the pelvic inlet but

does not advance for a considerable time, portions of the birth canal lying between it and the pelvic wall may be subjected to excessive pressure. As a circulation is impaired, the resulting necrosis may become manifest several days after delivery by the appearance of vesicovaginal, vesicocervical, or rectovaginal fistulas.

Danger of uterine rupture.
When the disproportion between the head and the pelvis is so pronounced that engagement and descent do not occur, the lower uterine segment becomes increasingly stretched, and the danger of its rupture ecornes imminent. In such cases, a pathologic contractile ring may form and can be felt as a transverse or oblique ridge extending across

e uterus somewhere between the symphysis and the umbilicus. Whenever condition is noted, prompt cesarean delivery must be employed to prevent rupture of the uterus.

'- Pushing occurs if fetal head is situated in the plane of inlet. In the case of clinically contracted pelvis - only cesarean section.

Pelvic classification according to form of contractions:

1. Often occurred

• generally contracted pelvis;

• flat pelvis: simple flat pelvis, flat rachitic pelvis, generally contracted.

Generally contracted pelvis is characterized by diminution of true pelvic diameters (anteroposterior, transverse, and oblique) into 2 cm. Subpubic arch is narrow. Average sizes of the pelvis are: D. spinarum - 23cm, D. cristarum - 26 cm. D. trochanterica - 29 cm, C. externa - ig cm, C. diagonalis — 11 cm, C. vera — 9 cm. Course of labor:

• prolongation of labor;

• considerable fetal head flexion thanks to which it is elongated in the ocipitofrontal diameter (dolichocepaly);

• posterior fontanel is situated into the axis of pelvis;

• considerable molding of the fetal head. Caput succedaneum is formed in the area of posterior fontanel;

• with increasing narrowing of the pubic arch, the occiput cannot emerge directly beneath the symphysis pubis but is forced increasingly farther down upon the ishiopubic rarni. It may play an important part in the production of perineal tears.

Management of labor. Vaginaliy delivery is possible.

Flat pelvis - is usually defined as diminution of anteroposterior diameters of true pelvis,transverse and oblique diameters are normal.

Simple flat pelvis is defined as shortening of anteroposterior diameters at all levels of true pelvis, as a result of this sacrum is inclined anteriorly to pubis.

Average sizes of the pelvis are: D. spinarum - 26cm, D. cristarum ~ 29 cm. D. trochanterica - 31 cm, C. externa - 18 cm, C. diagonalis - H cm, C. vera - 9 cm.

Course of labor:

• prolongation of labor;

• sagittal suture of the fetal head arresting in the transverse diarnetei

of the plane of inlet;

• fetal head extension until bitemporal fetal head diameter would W situated in the anteroposterior diameter of the plane of inlet;

• anterior fontanel is the leading point of the fetal head (lowermost situate"'1

• asynclitism should be presented (anterior or posterior);

• considerable molding of the fetal head. Caput succedaneum is iorme in the area of anterior fontanel.

Flat rachitic pelvis — is characterized by some peculiarities:

True conjugate is shortened.

Sidewalls tend to converge, as result of this D. spinarum and D. cristarum are equal.

Additional promontoriurn may be presented between 1 and 2 vertebrae of sacrum

Subpubic arch is shallow and wide.

Top of the sacrum is situated posteriorly that’s why dimensions of the pelvic outlet are normal or even increased.

Average sizes of the pelvis are: D. spinarum - 26cm, D. cristarum -26 cm.- D. trochanterica — 31 cm, C. externa — 17 cm, C. diagonalis — 10 cm, C. vera - 8 cm.

Course of labor is the same as in the simple flat pelvis. But thanks to normal or even increased anteroposterior size of pelvic outlet perineal tears as result of quick second stage labor may be presented.

Management of labor. Vaginal delivery is possible.

Generally contracted flat pelvis is characterized by combination of the signs of generally contracted and flat pelvis.

Average sizes of the pelvis are: D. spinarum — 24cm, D. cristarum — 25 cm., D. trochanterica - 28 cm, C. externa - 16 cm, C. diagonalis - 9 cm, C. vera — 7 cm.

Course of labor depends from predominance of kind of pelvis contraction.

Management of labor. Cesarean section is the method of choice.

Rare occurred contracted pelvis: obliquely contracted pelvis, obliquely dislocated pelvis,.transverse contracted pelvis.osteomalacic pelvis, lunnel-shaped pelvis, spondylolisthetic pelvis, contracted pelvis as a result °’ exostosis and bone tumors. Management of labor. Cesarean section should be performed in all of these types of pelvis.

Pelvic classification according to degree of contraction: Four degrees of pelvic contractions should be distinguished: I degree - True conjugate is 11-9 cm. Vaginal delivery is possible. II degree - True conjugate is 9-7,5 cm. Vaginal delivery is possible. III degree - True conjugate is 7,5 - 5.5 cm Cesarean section is Performed. IV - degree — True conjugate is 5.5 cm. Cesarean section is performed.

Ruptures of the cervix, vagina, perineum. Causes, diagnosis, treatment, prevention.

Uterine rupture: etiology and classification, complications for the mother and fetus, prevention.

Uterine rupture (ruptura uteri) is a traumatic injury of the completeness of

the organ during pregnancy or labor. Small rupture to the wall of the uterus in early months is called perforation either instrumental or perforating hydatidiform mole. Rupture of a rudimentary pregnant horn has got a special clinical entity and is grouped in ectopic pregnancy. Uterine rupture is rather serious obstetric pathology, accompanied by invalidization and high maternal and perinatal mortality: maternal mortality in uterine rapture accounts for 12-18 %, fetal death accounts for 35-40%. The prevalence widely varies from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 200 deliveries.

Etiology and pathogenesis

Uterine lacerations typically occur during labor and less frequently during pregnancy.

The risk group for uterine rupture during pregnancy:

· pregnant women with scarred uterus;

· multiparous pregnant women;

· the dilatation and curettage operation or manual removal of placenta;

· congenital malformation of the uterus (bicornuate variety) is a rare possibility;

· in Couvelaire uterus;

· injudicious administration of oxytocin;

· use of prostaglandins for induction of abortion or labor;

· forcible external version specially under general anesthesia;

· fall or blow on the abdomen.
The risk group for uterine rupture during labor:

· as above;

· macrosomia;

· overdistension of the uterus (polyhydramnios, multiple fetation);

· breech presentation;

· malpositions, such as brow;

75. Cesarean section: indications, contra-indications and conditions for operation.

76. Cesarean section: technique, complications.

Cesarean section is an operative procedure during which the pregnant uterus is incised and the fetus with all its extra embryonic formations is removed.

Vaginal birth after cesarean delivery

A prior cesarean is the second most common overall cause of cesarean delivery (25-30%). In fact, about 10-15% of pregnant women have had a previous cesarean delivery.

A trial of labor may be offered if one or two previous LTCDs have been performed, the uterine incision did not extend into the cervix or upper segment, and there is no history of prior uterine rupture. Adequate maternal pelvic dimensions should be noted by clinical examination. Personnel and equipment should be immediately available in case an emergent cesarean delivery is required within 30 minutes.

The overall success rate of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery is approximately 70%, although it ranges from 60% (dystocia) to 90% (malpresentation), depending on the indication for the previous cesarean delivery. Compared with repeat cesarean delivery, a successful vaginal delivery is associated with less maternal morbidity without any increase in perinatal morbidity. If uterine rupture does occur, there may be a 10-fold increase in perinatal mortality and substantial maternal morbidity as well.

77. Forceps: indications, contra-indications, conditions for forceps. Technique. Complications.

Obstetric forceps :Forceps are instruments designed to provide traction and/or rotation of the fetal head when the expulsive efforts of the mother are insufficient to accomplish safe delivery of the fetus. There are two classes of obstetric forceps: classical forceps and specialized forceps…

Classic or standard forceps are used to facilitate delivery by applying traction to the fetal skull. The components of each blade are illustrated in figure 44.

<![if !vml]>![ÐšÐ°Ñ€Ñ‚Ð¸Ð½ÐºÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾ÑÑƒ obstetrical operations in pictures](file:////Users/eternal/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image005.jpg)<![endif]>

Fig. 44. Obstetric forceps

The blades have a cephalic curve designed to conform to the curvature of the fetal head. Simpson forceps (an example of classic or standard forceps) have a tapered cephalic curve that is designed to fit on a molded fetal head. The pelvic curve of classic forceps approximates the shape of the birth canal (see fig.45).

Testing traction.

Traction for delivery of the head.

Removal of the forceps.

Guidelines and technique of application of forceps

If the head of the fetus is in the plane of the outlet of the small pelvis, the outlet obstetrical forceps (typical) are applied in the transversal size of the pelvis, and if the head is still in the narrow part of the small pelvis cavity the cavity obstetrical forceps (atypical) are applied in one of the oblique sizes of the pelvis.

The forceps-assisted extraction is performed in the following order:

Preparation to the operation:

Urinary bladder catheterization.
Cleansing of the external genitals.
Anesthesia.
Thorough vaginal examination is performed before operation to confirm the availability of the required prerequisites for application of forceps: detection of fully dilated cervix, raptured membranes, position of the head, determination of the sutures and vertices. Depending on the position of the head the variant of the operation is determined: cavity forceps application when the head is positioned in the narrow part of the true pelvis cavity or outlet forceps application if the head descends in the pelvic floor, i.e., in the outlet of the true pelvis.
Placement of forceps in locked position, identification of the left and right branches.

Rules of application of forceps

While studying the techniques of the operations one should be guided by the rule of three according to M.S. Malinovskiy.

The first rule of the rule of three is “three on the left, three on the right”. The left blade is introduced first by the left hand in the left side of the pelvis. The right blade is introduced secondly by the right hand in the right side of the pelvis.

The second rule of the rule of three is the “three axes”: in application of forceps three axes must coincide, i.e., longitudinal axis of the pelvis, head and forceps. For this purpose the forceps are introduced with the cephalic curve up, the blades should be placed on the head biparietally and the leading point should be in the same plane with the lock portion of the forceps.

The third rule of the rule of three is the “three positions-three tractions”.

— first position: position of the fetal head is at the inlet to the true pelvis by the small or large segment. Tractions are directed to the toes of the midwife who is in the sitting position. Forceps, applied at such position of the head are called high forceps and currently are not used.

— second position: the head is in the pelvic cavity. Tractions are directed to the knees of the midwife who is in the standing position. Forceps, applied at such position of the head are called cavity forceps.

— third position: the head is at the outlet of the true pelvis. Tractions are directed to the midwife himself/herself, and upwards after the point of fixation has been reached. Forceps, applied at such position of the head are called outlet forceps.

Operation technique is showed by figures 46:I-VIII.

Vacuum-extraction: indications, contra-indications, conditions and technique; complications for mother and fetus.
Vacuum extraction is the vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery when the baby is artificially extracted from the natural birth canal using a vacuum extractor. The principle of operation of the vacuum device is based on the creation of the vacuummetric pressure between the inner surface of the suction cup and the head of the fetus. The adhesive force occurs, enabling to make tractions, required for the extraction of the fetus (see fig.47).

<![if !vml]>![ÐšÐ°Ñ€Ñ‚Ð¸Ð½ÐºÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾ÑÑƒ obstetrical operations in pictures](file:////Users/eternal/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image016.jpg)<![endif]> Fig. 47. Vacuum extraction

Traction is then applied using principles similar to those described above for a forceps delivery. Flexion of the fetal head must be maintained to provide the smallest diameter to the maternal pelvis by placing the posterior edge of the suction cup 3 cm from the anterior fontanel squarely over the sagittal suture. With the aid of maternal pushing efforts, traction is applied parallel to the axis of the birth canal. Detachment of the suction cup from the fetal head during traction is termed a “pop-off.” If progress down the birth canal is not obtained with appropriate traction, or if two “pop-offs” occur, the procedure should be discontinued in favor of a cesarean delivery.

Major indications for vacuum extraction:

I. Maternal: complications during pregnancy, labor or somatic pathology that require shortening of the second stage of labor:

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>uterine inertia in the second stage of labor;

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>septic infectious diseases leading to deterioration of the maternal overall health, fever;

II. Fetal: progressing acute fetal hypoxia (distress) in the second stage of labor when the cesarean section is impossible.

Contraindications for vacuum extraction:

<![if !supportLists]>1. <![endif]>Cephalopelvic disproportion, namely: hydrocephalus; narrow pelvis of the 3, 4 degree or clinically narrow pelvis.

<![if !supportLists]>2. <![endif]>Dead fetus.

<![if !supportLists]>3. <![endif]>Face or brow presentation.

<![if !supportLists]>4. <![endif]>High straight standing of the head.

<![if !supportLists]>5. <![endif]>Pelvic presentation.

<![if !supportLists]>6. <![endif]>The cervix is not fully dilated.

<![if !supportLists]>7. <![endif]>Premature fetus (less than 30 weeks of gestation).

<![if !supportLists]>8. <![endif]>Obstetric or extragenital pathology that required exclusion of the second stage of labor.

Prerequisites:

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>alive fetus;

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>ruptured membranes;

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>fully dilated cervix;

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>cephalopelvic proportion;

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>vertex presentation;

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>active participation of the parturient woman in labor;

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>the head of the fetus must be in the true pelvis cavity or in the plane of the pelvic outlet;

<![if !supportLists]>• <![endif]>anesthesia: pudendal block.

There are two general categories of vacuum cup:

the rigid, mushroomshaped cups patterned after the original Malmstrom cup; and the soft, bell- or trumpet-shaped cups.

Selection of the kind of cups is purely individual. Possible complications

<![if !supportLists]>1. <![endif]>Slide down of the suction cup of the vacuum extractor. In the repeated slide downs the tractions must be ceased and finish the delivery by the application of forceps.

<![if !supportLists]>2. <![endif]>Fetal craniocerebral injury (hemorrhage), cephalohematoma.

Comparision of forceps and vacuum delivery

Vacuum and forceps delivery can be associated with significant complications, both maternal and fetal. Forceps have a higher overall success rate for vaginal delivery. The failure rate for forceps is 7%, whereas the failure rate for vacuum extraction is 12%. In general, forceps deliveries cause higher rates of maternal injury, and vacuum extraction causes higher rates of fetal morbidity. Forceps have an increased risk of trauma to vaginal and perineal tissues and damage to the maternal anal sphincter. In contrast, neonates delivered by vacuum have more cephalohematomas (accumulation of blood beneath the periosteum) and exclusively have subgaleal hematomas (blood in the space above the periosteum that has a large potential space and can allow significant blood loss) and retinal hemorrhages. Sequential use of one instrument followed by the other has been associated with a disproportionately high fetal morbidity rate and should be approached with extreme caution. Long-term retrospective studies of adolescents who were delivered by normal vaginal delivery, forceps, vacuum extractions, and cesarean delivery have shown little difference in physical or cognitive outcomes.

Two maternal deaths have been described in association with tearing of the cervix at vacuum delivery and a further maternal death has been described following uterine rupture in association with forceps delivery. Neonatal intracranial and subgaleal haemorrhage are life-threatening complications of particular concern… In a review of liveborn singleton infants born to nulliparous women, the rate of subdural or cerebral haemorrhage in vacuum deliveries did not differ significantly from that associated with forceps use (one in 664) or caesarean section during labour. However, risks increased significantly among babies exposed to attempts at both vacuum and forceps delivery (one in 256)

79. Postpartum mastitis: etiology, classification, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment.

LACTATIONAL MASTITIS

Lactational mastitis is inflammation of the mammary gland (mostly unilateral) during lactation in the puerperal period. It develops more frequently in 2—3 weeks after delivery.

Most frequently the portal entry of infection is nipple cracks, in-tracanalicular penetration of the infectious agent through the mam­mary ducts at breast feeding or expression of breast milk; the spread of the agent from endogenous foci is very rare.

Risk factors:

— nipple cracks;

— lactostasis.

Nipple cracks may take place at nipple malformations, late begin­ning of breast feeding, irregular feeding technique, feeding lasting longer than 20 min, rough expression of milk, individual lability of the epithelial nipple cover, violation of the sanitary-hygienic stan­dards of the puerperal period.

At lactostasis body temperature rise may last up to 24 h, if longer than 24 h — this condition is to be considered mastitis.

By the character of the inflammatory process course mastitis can be: serous; infiltrative; suppurative; infiltrative-suppurative, diffuse, nodular; suppurative (intramammary): areola furunculosis, areola ab­scess, abscess in the gland thickness, abscess behind the gland;

— phlegmonous, purulo-necrotic; gangrenous.

By focus localization mastitis can be: subcutaneous, subareolar, in­tramammary, retromammary and total.

The clinical presentation of mastitis is characterized by acute on­set, evident intoxication (general weakness, headache), body tempera­ture rise to 38—39° C, chill, pain in the region of the mammary gland increasing at feeding or expression. The mammary gland expands, hyperemia and tissue infiltration without clear margins are marked. This picture is characteristic of serous mastitis. If treatment is ineffective, serous mastitis develops into infiltrative during 1—3 days. Palpation detects dense, sharply painful infiltrate, lymphadenitis. This stage lasts 5—8 days. If the infiltrate does not resolve against the back­ground of the treatment being conducted, its suppuration takes place — suppurative mastitis (intramammary). Intensification of local inflam­mation symptoms is observed, considerable increase and deformation of the mammary gland; if the infiltrate is located not at a great depth, suppuration is accompanied by fluctuation. Infiltrate suppuration takes place during 48—72 h. If a couple of infiltrates have suppurated in the mammary gland, mastitis is called phlegmonous. Body temper­ature is 39-40 °C, chills, evident weakness, intoxication. The mam­mary gland is sharply enlarged, painful, pastose, well-marked surface venous network, the infiltrate occupies almost the whole gland, the skin above the damaged area is edematous, lustrous, red with a bluish tint, often with lymphangitis. At phlegmonous mastitis infection gen­eralization with transition into sepsis is possible. Diagnostics is based on:

— clinical data: examination of the mammary gland (see in the text), assessment of clinical presentation, complaints and anamnesis;

— laboratory: common blood analysis (leucogram), com in on urine analysis, bacteriological and bacterioscopic investigation of the exudate, immunogram, coagulogram and blood biochemistry;

— instrument findings: US is the main method of mastitis diag­nostics.

Treatment may be conservative and surgical.

Antibiotic therapy should be started from the first signs of the dis­ease, which promotes the prevention of suppurative inflammation de­velopment. At serous mastitis the question of breast feeding is decid­ed individually. One should take into account: opinion of the parturi­ent woman, anamnesis (for instance, suppurative mastitis in the anamnesis, multiple scars on the mammary gland, mammary gland prosthetics), antibiotic therapy, which is being conducted, the data of bacteriological and bacterioscopic investigations, nipple crack pres­ence and evidence. Beginning from infiltrative mastitis breast feeding is contraindicated because of a real threat of child’s infection and cu­mulative accumulation of antibiotics in the child’s organism, but lac­tation may be preserved by means of breast milk expression. If con­servative mastitis therapy is ineffective, surgical treatment is administered during 2—3 days. Surgical treatment consists in radical section, removal of the necrotized tissues and adequate drainage. At the same time antibiotic, disintoxication, and desensitizing therapy is being conducted. Timely surgical treatment allows preventing the develop­ment of the process and SIRS.

Postnatal mastitis prophylaxis consists in teaching women the rules of breast feeding and personal hygiene. Nipple crack and lactostasis are to be timely detected and treated.

POSTNATAL ENDOMETRITIS

Postnatal endometritis is inflammation of the superficial layer of endometrium. Endomyoinetritis (metroendometritis) is the spread of inflammation from the basal layer of endometrium to mvometrium. Perimetritis is the spread of inflammation from the endometrium and myometrium to the serous uterine layer.

The initial stage of postnatal infectious process may have different intensity

and polymorphous presentation. One should differentiate classical, obliterated and abortive forms of endomyometritis, endornyometritis after cesarean section. The classical form usually devel­ops on the 3rd ~5th day after delivery. This form is characterized .by fe­ver, intoxication, psyche alteration, evident leucocytosis with leucogram shift to the left, pathological discharge from the uterus. At. the obliterated form of endomyometritis disease usually develops on the 8th-9th day after delivery, temperature is subfebrile, local rnanifestations are low-grade. The abortive form has a course similar to the classical form, but is quickly arrested at a high level of immunologic;il protection. Endomyometritis after cesarean section is often complicated with pelviperitonitis, peritonitis, which may develop during the : 1st—2nd day after the surgery.

Diagnostics is based on:

— clinical data: complaints, anamnesis, clinical examination. Vagi­nal examination shows the moderately sensitive uterus, subinvolution of the uterus, purulent discharge;

— laboratory data: common blood count (leucogram), common urine analysis, bacteriological and bacterioscopic investigation of the cervical and uterine discharge (urine and blood if it is necessary), immunogram, blood biochemistry;

— instrument data: US.

Treatment: in most cases the treatment is pharmacological, but surgical is also possible.

Complex treatment of postnatal endomyometritis includes not only systemic antibacterial, infusion, detosication therapy, but also local treatment. Antibiotic therapy may be empirical and object-ori­entated (see above). Preference is given to object-orientated antibi­otic therapy, which is possible by using accelerated methods of agent identification (using multimicrotest system). If fever lasts during 48—72 h after treatment beginning, one should suspect resistance of the agent to the applied antibiotics. Treatment with intravenous an­tibiotics is to last for 48 h after disappearance of hyperthennia and other symptoms. Tableted antibiotics are to be administered for 5 more days. Antibiotics get into the maternal milk in small doses. In most cases it does not lead to clinically significant consequences. Nevertheless, the immature ferment system of the newborn may not manage the complete excretion of antibiotics, which may cause a cu­mulative effect.

Local endomyometntis therapy consists in aspiration-washing drainage of the uterine cavity with the application of a dual-lumen catheter, through which the uterine walls are irrigated with solutions of antiseptics, antibiotics. There are used cooled to +4° C solutions of 0.02 % furacilinum, 0.02 % chlorhexine, 0.9 % isotonic solution with the speed of 10 ml/min. Contraindications to aspiration-washing drainage of the uterine cavity are: inconsistency of sutures on the uterus after cesarean section, infection spread beyond the uterus, up to 3—4 days of puerperal period. If it is not possible to wash the path­ological inclusions in the uterine cavity by means of drainage, they are to be removed by vacuum aspiration or careful curettage against the background of the conducted antibacterial therapy and normal temperature if it is possible. Correct treatment of postnatal endomyo-metritis makes the basis of the prevention of widespread forms of in­fectious diseases in parturient women and their localization at the first stage.

Surgical treatment consists in laparotomy and extirpation of the uterus without the appendages or extirpation of the uterus with, the uterine tubes, or with the appendages, depending on the spread of the inflammatory process. Surgical treatment is resorted to in case of con­servative treatment inefficiency and presence of negative dynamics during the first 24—48 h of treatment, development of systemic in­flammatory response symptom (SIRS).
