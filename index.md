Not the resource website you deserve, but the one you need right now
Are you a medical student looking for resources to enhance your MBBS studies? Look no further! Here is a collection of valuable resources, including textbooks, journals, online courses, and software, to help you excel in your studies. While some of the resources may be specific to students in Belarus (I try to mark them with a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¾ emoji), but the majority can be useful to any MBBS student anywhere in the world. Whether you're just starting your studies or preparing for your exams, these resources are here to help you succeed.

This is meant to be a collaborative endeavor, so if you have things to add, you're more than welcome to contribute by <a href="mailto:arshilkhan38@gmail.com?subject=contributing to MBBS Resources">sending me an email</a>.

> Warning: I have not tested all of these tools myself, so be sure to check that they are safe and up-to-date before using them.
